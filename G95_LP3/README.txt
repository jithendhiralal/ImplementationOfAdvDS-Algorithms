In this project with have computed shortest path algorithm using BFS,Dijkstra's algorithm, DAG shortest paths, and Bellman-Ford algorithm. We did the project in two levels.

For Level One: Please run Driver.java and

For level two: Please run DriverLevel2.java

For level two, We computed the total number of shortest path by marking the edges.
