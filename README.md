# ImplementationOfAdvDS-Algorithms
The implementation of following set of projects were done in this repository. 
The LP sections consists of Long Projects and SP tag has short projects in it. All the programs were tested with millions
and billions of records.

LP0   : This program implements Hierholzer's algorithm and finds the Euler tour for a given undirected graph. 

LP1   : Implementation of arithmetic with large integers, of arbitrary size.

LP2   : Minimum Spanning Tree implementation of Prims algorithm, Prims algorithm using Indexed Heap and Kruskal's algorithm

LP3   : Computed shortest path algorithm using BFS,Dijkstra's algorithm, DAG shortest paths, and Bellman-Ford algorithm.

LP4   : Multi-dimensional search. This implementation was done to emulate Online Shopping websites similar to Amazon, eBay,etc.

LP5   : Maximal Matching problem for Bi-partitite graphs.

SP0   : Comparison of Sorting algorithms.

SP0H  : Programs using Hashing algorithms. 

SP0SL : Implementation of SkipLists with Big numbers

SP0PQ : Implementation of Priority Queues with and without Index

SP1   : Union, Intersection and Set Difference of Sets, Addition and Subtraction of Large numbers, Recursive Algorithm without Recursion,
        MultiUnzip Algorithm, Reverse a linkedlist
        
SP2   : Topological Sorting, Diameter of tree, Kosaraju algorithm, OddLength Cycle and Testing Eulerian paths

SP3   : Fibonacci Series with O(n) and O(logn) operations. Activity selection problems.

SP4   : Level Order Traversal, Balanced binary search tree from a sorted array, Remove operation in BST, AVL tree verifications.

SP5   : Permutations and Combinations of huge numbers, Knuth's algorithm
