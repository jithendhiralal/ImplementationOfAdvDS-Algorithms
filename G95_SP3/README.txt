a) Fibonacci numbers:
In this problem we compared two different algorithms to find the fibonacci numbers with different running time. Algorithm implemented in log time beats the linear Fibonacci algorithm with big difference in timing.

Sample Input:
82

Sample Output:
Time: 5154 msec.
Memory: 2 MB / 128 MB.
Fibonacci of 82 in O(n) 206354
Time: 0 msec.
Memory: 2 MB / 128 MB.
Fibonacci of 82 in O(Log n) 206354

d) Selection Problem:
In this problem we compared two different approach to find the Kth largest element in an array.Out of two Selection using partition is faster when compared to selection using maxheap.

arr = {2, 3, 11, 16, 27, 4, 15, 9, 8}
Sample Input:
3

Sample Output:
The 3 largest element using  selectUsingMaxHeap is : 15
Time: 2 msec.
Memory: 2 MB / 128 MB.
The 3 largest element using selectUsingPartition is : 15
Time: 1 msec.
Memory: 2 MB / 128 MB.
