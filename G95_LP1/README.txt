This program implements arithmetic with large integers, of arbitrary size. Two levels of this project has been submitted.

We have used BigInt class which will consist of methods to implement add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, modulus and square root of
long numbers. With the help of LinkedList operations were performed.

Thw whole program is implemented for base b = 10.

level 1: All the functionalities implemented for base 10.

level 2: All the functionalities implemented except I/O specification.

Our illustrated I/O specification:

Input:

Enter a : 10
Enter b : 2

Output
Addition of BigInt : 2 1
Subtraction of BigInt: 8
Multiplication of BigInt : 0 2
Power of BigInt to the ^ long: 0 0 1
Power of BigInt to the ^ BignInt : 0 0 1
Division of  BigInt: 5
Mod of BigInt : 0
Squareroot of BigInt a : 3
Squareroot of BigInt b : 1
