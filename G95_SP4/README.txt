a. Level order

We had written a method in the BinarySearchTree.java to construct the level order of the given BST and store them in an array.

b. Balanced binary search tree from a sorted array

We had written a constructor in the BinarySearchTree.java to build BST when creating the object for the Tree.

c. Modifying remove in BST class

We had modified the removeTwo method added a flag to alternate the possiblity to get min of Right subtree and get max of left substree

d. Correcting poorly written code on trees

Instead of calculating height and depth everytime, we stored thoses data's in the node itself. We will calculate once and save it.

f. AVL tree verification

Created an Util function to check whether the tree is balanced and it satifies the BST properties and node should not be null.
