a) Union, Intersection and Difference of the sets:
This is a program to find the union, intersection and difference of the two linked list, which has no duplicate elements. 
To test this program, please give the number of nodes for list1 and enter the values for list1 and give the number of nodes for list2 and enter the values for list2.

Sample Input:
Set Operations Implementation
Enter no of elements for list1: 5
Enter the elements: 1 3 5 7 8
Enter no of elements for list2: 6
Enter the elements: 1 4 5 6 9 10

Sample Output:
Union
1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Intersection
1 5
Set Difference
3 7 8

b) Addition and Subtraction of Large numbers:
To implement this logic, we have to consider numbers as lists. Here we used Linkedlist to store numbers. 
To test this program, please give the base and number of digits for x and enter the value for x and number of digits for y and enter the value for y.
If the input is base = 10, x= 11000001 and y = 12345 then

Sample Input:
List Addition and subtraction Implementation:
Enter base value: 10
Enter no of elements for list1: 8
Enter the elemetns: 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
Enter no of elements for list2: 5
Enter the elements: 5 4 3 2 1

Sample Output:
Addition
6 4 3 2 1 0 1 1
subtraction
6 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

d) Recursive Algorithm without Recursion:
For this program, we simulated a binary search tree pre-order traversal. To test this program, please give the number of nodes in the tree and give the elements.

Sample Input:
Recursion using Stack Implementation:
Enter no of nodes: 9
Enter the elements: 5 4 3 2 1 6 7 8 9

Sample Output:
Pre Order Traversal
5 4 3 2 1 6 7 8 9

e) MultiUnzip Algorithm:
For this program, we have implemented with the logic of list of arraylists. To test this program, please give the value k and give the number of nodes and enter the elements of the list.

Sample Input:
MultiUnzip of linked List Implementation 
Enter the position of the list to unzip from: 2
Enter the size of the list: 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Sample Output:
1 3 5 7 9 2 4 6 8 10

f) Reverse linked list
For i) and ii) we implemented with both recursive and non recursive algorithms. To test this program, please give the number of nodes and enter the elements of the list.

Sample Input:
Reverse a Linked List:
Enter no of nodes: 5
Enter the elements: 1 2 3 4 5

Sample Output:
Reverse and print order using Recursion:
5 4 3 2 1
Reverse and print order using Non-Recursion:
1 2 3 4 5
